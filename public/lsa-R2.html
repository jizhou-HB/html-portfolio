                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>PISA project is OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA measures 15-year-olds' ability to use their reading, 
                    mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges. They also measure context factors which help with explaning these performance differences.
                    The Educational Testing Service (ETS) was responsible for the development of the assessment of student achievement as well as contextual questionnaires. We are a research team from DIPF 
                    responsible for contextual questionnaires.<br></p>

                        <h3>Questionnaire Development</h3>
                        <p>I worked as postdoc research associate for the PISA 2018 project and was responsible for the optimization of several questionnaires such as teacher questionnaire, student motivation scales, etc.
                            Based on the Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory, we have evaluated the psychometrical quality of scales and derived variables. 
                            With the help of my data analysis and presentation at the QEG meeting in ETS, the questionnaire experts from renowned universities were able to make item decision for all the scales in PISA contextual questionnare within two days. </p>

                        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                        <p>PISA field test data was multiple datasets from more than 70 countires. They were also multi-level data including weighting variables, proxy variables, etc.
                            So using tools such as R, Excel and SPSS, I have completed tasks such as data-clearning, -transforming,-visualization, -analyzing or modeling. 
                        Multiple statiscal methods were applied (eg. Reliability and Factor analysis, correlation and regression, IRT-based DIF analysis, Hierarchical Linear Modeling, etc.)   </p>

                        <h3>Online Survey UX optimization</h3>
                        <p>One of the task for me was also coordinating the adaptation and harmonization process. PISA 2018 project included more than 70 national questionnaires,
                            which should be as comparable as possible. The coordination among different national PM teams and ETS included not only understanding of the educational system of a specific country,the needs of stakeholders, 
                            but also the ability of detecting details for a deviation by comparing multiple documentations or analysis results.
