                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>The National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) is the largest long-term educational study in Germany. In seven starting cohorts, the development of competencies and the educational trajectories of a total of more than 70,000 participants are monitored - from early childhood to old age. 
                    I am responsible for the questionnaire developmnet, data collection for Starting Cohort 8 and the coordination of some collaboration projects.<br></p>
                    <p>What is NEPS:

                        <h3>Questionnaire Development</h3>
                        <p>I worked as postdoc research associate for NEPS and was responsible for the optimization of several questionnaires such as teacher/principal questionnaire, student contextual scales, etc.
                            Quality control, coordination of collaboration with internal research groups (IFS from TU Dortmund) and external collaborators such as IQB, Infas, IEA, project management are also part of my work. </p>

                        <h3>Data Analysis</h3>
                        <p>NEPS data is open to every researcher, but is also complex like a maze given its huge covarage of concpets, generations, data waves, etc. My advantages working in developing tools for NEPS are that I am more familiar with data structure itself. 
                            So using tools such as R and Mplus, I was able to explore and analyze the data. Fruitful collaboration with others yield to 6 publications within the following year I left LIfBi. </p>

                        <h3>Online Survey UX optimization</h3>
                        <p>One of the task for me was also to optimize the UI of the online survey. Tasks included the coordination of some discussion among RGs on topics such as responsive design of questionnare UI, arrangement of options/answers, design of user navigation for different user groups(student or principal), etc.  </p>

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p> For starting cohort 8 we would like to investigate some new concepts, which should be adapted from existing scales. Besides questionnaier, we also needed 
                        to collaborate with Infas in order to adapt the interview schema for individual follow-up studies to new needs and requirements.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="detail-tile">
                    <h3>Approaches</h3>
                    <p> For such a huge project like NEPS, understanding the needs of stakeholders and the background is essential. Normally we do not need to develop new concepts and scales, 
                        but we do need evaluate the quality or performance of a specific scale and adapt it if required. Estimating cost of an item(time, space, etc.) and prioritizing concepts were also crutial for decision making.
                        For the telephone-interview study with individuals who dropped out the longitudinal study, several issues were challenging: data privacy (with teenagers under 14 year-old), branching logic or switch questions design. 
                        I worked with experienced colleagues from Infas and data privacy group, and have overcome the challenges.

                    <h3>Objectives</h3>
                    <p>As postdoc we needed papers. But They are not only papers. There are thousands of insights hidden in the sand of data. The objectives of this part are to understand 
                        the large-scale longitudinal multilevel data, to clean and repair the data (eg.for the case when class ID was missing), to dig out possible relationship, to find the most
                        suitable methods, to present the findings to others.

                    The following are some examples.</p>

                    <h3>Background/Objective</h3>
                    <p>NEPS study recruite voluntary participants. Given the long list of concepts and huge crowd of stakeholders, arranging concepts in a meaningful and inviting way is crutial. More important is of course, the UI design of the online survey platform.

                <div class="detail-tile">
                    <h3>Approaches</h3>
                    <p>So there were some UX relevant decisions to make: if we should use horizontal or vertical arrangement of options/answers, if this will be changed based on option number, types, devices, 
                        if we should set some time-out principle, if we should use Navi bar which allows exit, etc. The decisions should be made quickly as possible,but budget is little.   
                    So mainly we relied on secondary research, previous literature with similar contexts and target groups were summarized. </p>

                <div class="detail-tile">
                    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                    <p>After some conclusion summary from literature, analysis of the small sample testing data, we were able to make decisions and optimize the UX UI of the surveys.</p>
