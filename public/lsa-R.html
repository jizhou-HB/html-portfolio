                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>PISA project is OECD's Programme for International Student Assessment. PISA measures 15-year-olds' ability to use their reading, 
                    mathematics and science knowledge and skills to meet real-life challenges. They also measure context factors which help with explaning these performance differences.
                    The Educational Testing Service (ETS) was responsible for the development of the assessment of student achievement as well as contextual questionnaires. We are a research team from DIPF 
                    responsible for contextual questionnaires.<br></p>
                    <p>What is PISA:

                        <h3>Questionnaire Development</h3>
                        <p>I worked as postdoc research associate for the PISA 2018 project and was responsible for the optimization of several questionnaires such as teacher questionnaire, student motivation scales, etc.
                            Based on the Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory, we have evaluated the psychometrical quality of scales and derived variables. 
                            With the help of my data analysis and presentation at the QEG meeting in ETS, the questionnaire experts from renowned universities were able to make item decision for all the scales in PISA contextual questionnare within two days. </p>

                        <h3>Data analysis</h3>
                        <p>The PISA field test data comprised multiple datasets from over 70 countries and included complex, 
                            multi-level structures with weighting and proxy variables. Using tools such as R, Excel, and SPSS, 
                            I conducted data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and analysis/modeling. 
                            I frequently utilized R packages like dplyr for data cleaning and ggplot2 for visualization. 
                            Various statistical methods were applied, including reliability and factor analysis, correlation and regression, 
                            IRT-based DIF analysis, and Hierarchical Linear Modeling. </p>

                        <h3>Adaptation and harmonization</h3>
                        <p>I also coordinated the adaptation and harmonization process for the PISA 2018 project, 
                            which involved over 70 national questionnaires requiring high comparability. 
                            This role entailed collaboration with national PM teams and ETS, requiring an in-depth understanding of each country's educational system and stakeholder needs.
                            Additionally, I was responsible for identifying deviations by closely analyzing documentation and comparing analysis results.

                        and learning environment scales. Using test theory, I selected evaluation criteria to guide item selection decisions. 
                        I presented the results, enabling the Questionnaire Experts to make timely decisions. 
                        <br>Additionally, I identified potential improvements to the existing scoring method, conducted comparative analyses, and published the findings in a Q1 journal paper.</p>

                    <h3>Background/Objective</h3>
                    <p>Since there were questionnaires for more than 70 countries, it was difficult to ensure that things were comparable among these countries because concept can be totally different.
                        Adaptation and harmonization aimed at reducing such variance among countries. Through this step concepts can be somehow comparable.

                <div class="detail-tile">
                    <h3>Tools and scripts</h3>
                    <p>Besides knowing the educational systems all around the world, the ability of detecting differences by comparing multiple documatations was also a way to achieve the goal. 
                        Comparing scaling documents for one country across cycles, knowing the revolution events in between, or comparing levels across countries belong to the work. In order to evaluate 
                    concepts, sometimes we also needed to collect information about the evaluation of specific scales from national project managers'(NPM) perspectives.    </p>

                    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
                    <p>Normally we have answered NPMs' questions succussfully by documentation mining process. PISA questionnaires across countries were also considered comparable based on the data-based report. </p>
