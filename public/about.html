<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Before the age of 30, I reached the destination I have set for myself before: become a AP in the best psychology department of China. </p>

<p>However, because a family decision, I have taken a new journey, which was told not easy. Erfahrungswerte/told facts: no (immigrant,no German native speaker) PhD in social science majors will have a bright future in Germany </p>

<p>Now I am still struggling. But I know I can always trust myself, my ability to learn, with support from my family and friends. </p>
<p> I have experience in the following domains </p>
  <ul>
   <li>data analysis</li>
   <li>UX research</li>
   <li>UX design</li>
  </ul>
<p>Through the journey i have learnt a lot that might not be touched if I live in the other paralle world which I did not choose.</p>
